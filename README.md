**Anki Add Furigana**

A very raw project that I used for a one time transformation of an anki deck.
It unzips the anki format opens the database and does a bunch of things with the data.
In my case mostly just adding furigana and some model merging.

This is project as is can not really be used outside of this purpose, but you can easily alter it. Though I doubt it will have much use.
